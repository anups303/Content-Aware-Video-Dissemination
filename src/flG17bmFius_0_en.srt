1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well good morning everyone. I am delighted 
to welcome you to the State Department

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,500
for the beginning of the 7th Annual Strategic 
and Economic Dialogue and the Sixth

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Consultation on the People to People Exchange.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
We have a lot of ground to cover this morning,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,500
a very very full agenda so we want to get
right to it. The first speaker is a friend of mine

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,500
for forty years and reminded us a few minutes
ago we served together for years on the

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Foreign Relations Committee, he was my
chairman and now our Vice President

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,500
of the United States. He was certainly
one of the most knowledgeable

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
and accomplished leaders on foreign affairs

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,500
and I might add was almost always
ahead of the curve on most of the issues

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,899
facing us during the time when we
were in the Senate. So, my pleasure

12
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,099
SECRETARY KERRY: I welcome my friend,

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,500
the Vice President of the United States,
Joe Biden.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:08,299
(Applause.)

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,180
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Mr. Secretary, thanks
for letting us in your house. I appreciate

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,590
being able to be here. And with Secretary
Lew, I just say to our Chinese friends, I

17
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,060
notice you looking at the Secretary on crutches
and our Secretary of Commerce on crutches

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,590
– it’s a difficult job in Washington.
(Laughter.) We play it very – Hank Paulson

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,170
can tell you it’s a very tough place right
now. And I just want you to understand that

20
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,829
and why – that’s why they’re so committed
to this relationship.

21
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,129
Vice Premier Liu and Vice Premier Wang, State
Councilor Yang – it’s good to see you

22
00:01:53,129 --> 00:02:03,049
again. We’ve spent a lot of time together.
And we each have been – all of whom have

23
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:11,669
been designated special representatives of
President Xi. I’m really honored to welcome

24
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:18,339
the entire Chinese delegation for the seventh
U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue and

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:28,128
the sixth U.S.-China Consultation on People-to-People
Exchanges. And I want to thank Ambassador

26
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:33,429
Cui and Ambassador Baucus – it’s good
to see you, Max; welcome home – for being

27
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,420
here today. And I’d be remiss if I didn’t
recognize other members of the Cabinet. Secretary

28
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:47,328
Moniz is here as well as Secretary Pritzker,
who I already referenced, and Ambassador Froman

29
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:54,319
and Administrator McCarthy. And it’s – they
all are deeply involved and deeply committed

30
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,929
to this dialogue.

31
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:04,370
Four years ago in Beijing, then-Vice President
Xi observed, “If one is to have a full view

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:12,639
of the scenery, one needs to cast his eyes
to the far horizon.” Well, that’s what

33
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,159
we need to be doing here today – cast our
eyes to the far horizon. And we need to be

34
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:26,899
honest and direct about where we’ve been,
what lies on the horizon for the relationship

35
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,968
that will in many ways define the 21st century
for the remainder of the world.

36
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:43,810
It’s been ten years since then-Deputy Secretary
of State Robert Zoellick called on China to

37
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:51,748
become what he referred to as a responsible
stakeholder. He said all nations conduct diplomacy

38
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:58,598
to promote their national interest. Responsible
stakeholders go further; they recognize that

39
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:05,918
the international system sustains their peaceful
prosperity, so they work to sustain that system.

40
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:13,669
And under President Xi, as China’s interests
and capabilities have grown increasingly global,

41
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:18,699
China has indeed taken some important steps
in that direction.

42
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:26,250
For example, you have served as a partner
to curb nuclear activities in Iran and North

43
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,509
Korea. You’ve taken concrete actions to
address climate change, setting ambitious

44
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:39,479
climate goals at home. You’ve committed
to let the market play a greater role in your

45
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,779
economy, which will contribute to a stronger
and more sustainable growth in the global

46
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:51,459
economy. You supported efforts at the United
Nations to combat radical terrorism, to stem

47
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:58,579
the ability of extremist groups like ISIL
to recruit, and so much more. Chinese medical

48
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:04,508
personnel worked side by side with Americans
to fight Ebola and set up hospitals in Sierra

49
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:10,669
Leone. And China has been a leading contributor
to the United Nations peacekeeping operations

50
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:17,568
and has assisted in efforts to bring lasting
peace and stability in both Afghanistan and

51
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:21,039
the Sudan.

52
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,149
These are welcome actions that impact in a
very positive way the growth and security

53
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:34,388
of China, but also the region and the world.
And I believe that the future of China’s

54
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:41,038
success and global influence is directly tied
to the extent to which it acts as a responsible

55
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:51,509
stakeholder. Essential to this is continuing
to find new ways to work together even as

56
00:05:51,509 --> 00:06:00,330
we manage future competition in a responsible
way. We must all embrace the role of responsible

57
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:07,899
competitor as well, helping to create and
uphold a playing field that is level, fair,

58
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:13,788
and transparent – a field where the rules
apply equally not only to the United States

59
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:20,050
and China, but to all responsible competitors
regardless of their size.

60
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,538
The rule-based order that emerged in the 20th
century has served the world extremely well,

61
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:33,288
and, I would respectfully suggest, including
China. It provided the ballast for remarkable

62
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:39,459
peace and prosperity that ensued after the
war. And we’d be foolish today to hastily

63
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,000
discard or ignore all of it. But we have to
recognize that some of the rules, such as

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,629
environmental and labor standards, have to
be updated in the 21st century. Some institutions,

65
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,530
such as the International Monetary Fund, they
should be updated as well and revised to reflect

66
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,579
the world as it is, not as it was.

67
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:09,359
And there’s an urgent need to agree on a
rule-based system for rapidly evolving areas

68
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:20,509
ranging from cyber space to outer space – a
new set of rules. Together, collaboratively,

69
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,680
we have an obligation – China and the United
States – to shape these rules. And let me

70
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:35,310
be clear: The United States believes strongly
that whenever possible, China needs to be

71
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,908
at the table as these new rules are written.
Responsible competition, adhering to these

72
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:48,918
common rules – both old and new – in my
view will be the essential ingredient necessary

73
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:58,758
to manage areas of disagreement, and to build
the long-term sustainable U.S.-China relationship.

74
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,979
As President Xi has said, “There’s competition
in cooperation.” Yet such competition is

75
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:14,930
healthy, based on mutual learning and mutual
reinforcement. It’s a fundamental sense.

76
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:22,560
It is conducive to our common development.
I believe that. The President of the United

77
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,030
States believes that. The Secretary of State
believes that. And as I’ve told President

78
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,129
Xi on multiple occasions I’ve had to be
with him over the last several years, we – the

79
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:40,939
United States – we welcome fair and healthy
competition. Quite frankly, you’ve awakened

80
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,970
us. We got a little slow. We were a little
– I know my colleagues don’t like my saying

81
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:57,420
this, but the truth is we got a little – how
can I say it – too comfortable in the last

82
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:04,059
part of the 20th century. It awakened the
competitive spirit that’s stamped into the

83
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:11,359
DNA of every American, naturalized as well
as native born. And a lot of them are Chinese,

84
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,909
I might add.

85
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:18,778
I believe the United States of America is
not only well positioned to thrive, but to

86
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,809
contribute to the economic growth of the entire
world as we grow. We’re in the midst in

87
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:31,439
the United States of an energy transformation
that has positioned us as the epicenter of

88
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:40,050
the world’s energy sector over the 21st
century, including renewable energy. We have

89
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:44,889
the finest research universities in the world
that educate millions of Americans and the

90
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:51,778
brightest minds from around the world, including
China. We’re the top destination for immigration

91
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:59,759
from entrepreneurs, scientists, academics,
and artists who bring creative solutions and

92
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,100
want to create an open and welcoming environment.
It’s the creative edge we have, being as

93
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,920
open as we are to immigration.

94
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,849
The best of the world make their way here.
It’s not that someone sits around a table

95
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,190
in Southeast Asia or Africa or Latin America
and says, “I’ve got a great idea. Why

96
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,490
don’t we sell everything we have, pick up,
get smuggled into a country that doesn’t

97
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,129
want us? We’re going to have fun, aren’t
we? This is wonderful.” The truth is the

98
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:41,679
people who make those judgments are people
with courage and vision, optimism, innovation.

99
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:49,409
So we have benefited from the openness of
our system over the last 200 and some years.

100
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:56,179
We also in the United States protect innovation
from those – the innovation that emanates

101
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:01,759
from those great minds – through strong
protection of intellectual property and the

102
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:08,649
rule of law. Fair competition not only spurs
our companies to develop better products and

103
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:15,089
services; it spurs economic growth around
the world. On a level playing field, our growth

104
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:21,740
contributes to yours, and your growth in China
contributes to ours. Your nation has opened

105
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:28,759
up to the world and you have lifted 500 million
people out of poverty, one of the most remarkable

106
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:38,939
occurrences in human history – 500 million
people out of poverty. Your traditions of

107
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:46,130
scholarship, philosophy, entrepreneurship,
and ambition are now paired with an increasingly

108
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:52,860
educated public, including the education of
millions of engineers and scientists from

109
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,589
your finest universities.

110
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:02,680
The economic dynamism of your nation has supported
the prosperity and growth of not only China,

111
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:09,239
but throughout Asia. The future contributions
of a successful, open, and collaborative China

112
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,250
that embraces the responsibility of a stakeholder
and a responsible competitor have tremendous

113
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:24,778
potential for all of us, the whole world.
But any country that relies on unhealthy practices

114
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:31,019
to undermine healthy competition with others
ultimately limits itself. There’s sort of

115
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,289
like – there’s new rules of economics
in the 21st century not set by any nation;

116
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:40,549
they’re like rules of physics. There are
certain things that have to exist for nations

117
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:46,469
to truly meet their potential. Responsible
competitors help to sustain the system where

118
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,790
research and development are rewarded, where
intellectual property is protected, and the

119
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:57,049
rule of law is upheld, because nations that
use cyber technology as an economic weapon

120
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:01,479
or profits from the theft of intellectual
property are sacrificing tomorrow’s gains

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,879
for short-term gains today. They diminish
the innovative drive and determination of

122
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:17,208
their own people when they do not reward and
protect intellectual property.

123
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,359
Responsible companies adhere to international
law and work together to keep international

124
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,230
sea lanes open for unimpaired commerce. Eighty
percent of all the commerce today is on the

125
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:37,500
back of a ship somewhere floating on the oceans
– 80 percent of all the world’s economy.

126
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,639
The notion of sea lanes being open and protected
is even more crucial today than any time in

127
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:51,350
human history because of the interconnectedness
of the world and global economy. Because nations

128
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,579
that disregard diplomacy and use coercion
and intimidation to settle disputes or turned

129
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,979
a blind eye to aggression of others only invite
instability and undermine the collaborative

130
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,909
goals of the international community. And
I can think of no nation that will greater

131
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:13,000
benefit from international – an international
economic collaboration than China and the

132
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,799
United States.

133
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,578
And responsible competitors draw on the talents
of every part of their societies. This is

134
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:26,609
not lecturing; please do not misunderstand
me. This is just one of those economic rules,

135
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:32,730
like rules of physics in the 21st century
– protecting the rights and voices of women,

136
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,690
minorities, journalists, civil society, religious
leaders; allowing nongovernmental organizations

137
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,230
and educational groups to operate without
harassment, intimidation, or detention. In

138
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,180
short, they respect human rights not just
because it’s the right thing to do, but

139
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:56,159
because it’s absolutely economically necessary.
I think it’s originally, actually, in a

140
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:05,149
Chinese expression: Women hold up half the
sky. Women hold up half the sky. Nations that

141
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,278
do not take advantage of the populations – and
I’m not directing this at any particular

142
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,828
country – any nation that doesn’t take
advantage of it is squandering their potential,

143
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:22,439
because as surely as people cannot live without
blood coursing through their veins, societies

144
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:30,850
cannot thrive without the full participation
of all its citizens. Just like the basic rules

145
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,190
of physics, as I said, there are underlying
tenets of fair and responsible competition

146
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,829
that comprise the path to stability and prosperity
in the 21st century for all nations.

147
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:47,429
And let me be crystal clear, and I know my
friends and I have become – have made some

148
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:55,508
friendships in your leadership. Let me be
clear: We do not fear China’s rise. We want

149
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:01,350
to see China rise, to continue to rise in
a responsible way that will benefit you most,

150
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,389
China, because you have an important role
to play. A rising China can be a significant

151
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,948
asset for the region and the world, and selfishly,
for the United States.

152
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:15,289
China, like all nations in Asia, benefits
from stability and prosperity – a stability

153
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:19,899
and prosperity that, quite frankly, has been
maintained over – since the end of the World

154
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:25,100
War II by the United States of America for
60 years. We’re going to continue to play

155
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:33,509
a role for decades to come, but don’t misunderstand
it: We are a Pacific nation. 7,632 miles of

156
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:42,278
our shoreline breaks on the Pacific Ocean.
We are a Pacific nation. What happens anywhere

157
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:47,850
in the Pacific affects the United States as
much as – more than any other portion of

158
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:54,899
the world. And now we are a Pacific power,
and we’re going to continue to remain a

159
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,350
Pacific power. To respond to the changing
world, the Administration has set in motion

160
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,669
an institutionalized rebalance policy of the
Asian Pacific region, not to contain but to

161
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:08,850
expand all of our opportunities.

162
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,230
We believe this is important because the Pacific
and every nation along its shore from Chile

163
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,890
to China will form the economic engine that
drives the economies of the 21st century.

164
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:27,720
That’s where the action will be. As part
of that rebalanced strategy, we’ve strengthened

165
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,519
and modernized our alliances and our partnerships
throughout the region. As part of that strategy,

166
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,470
we have deepened our support for important
regional institutions like ASEAN, and we’re

167
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,130
continuing to work on the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
which I predict we will succeed in getting

168
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:49,970
done – the most progressive trade agreement
in American history, and history, period.

169
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,720
It boosts economic growth at home and abroad.

170
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,870
And as part of that strategy, we’re working
to build more constructive and productive

171
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:05,109
ties with China. But we all know this relationship
is complicated and consequential, to say the

172
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:11,139
least. And we all know, like a good marriage,
it requires an awful lot of hard, hard work,

173
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:20,370
an awful lot of attention. In 1979, I was
a young junior senator and I was invited to

174
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:27,319
go to China with a group of senior, important
senators – the first delegation to visit

175
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,450
China after normalization and to meet with
Deng Xiaoping. We had an opportunity to spend

176
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,460
a considerable amount of time with him. I
was criticized when I got back home because

177
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,929
I was asked what did I think, and I said,
“I think that a rising and peaceful China

178
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:52,220
could provide an extremely positive incentive
for the United States and the world.” I

179
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,788
still believe that. I believed it in 1979
that that was possible, and I believe it’s

180
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,400
even more likely today.

181
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,538
Then as now, I recognized that our two countries
had clear disagreements on important issues.

182
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:13,589
But that’s not a new phenomenon. The animating
logic of our relationship is also not new.

183
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:19,058
Both sides accept that we each gain by working
together where our interests align, and addressing

184
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:24,869
our differences candidly and constructively
where they do not. And there are places where

185
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:29,058
they will not align.

186
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:35,609
In reviewing the course that has led us to
today, I think it’s worth recalling that

187
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:41,788
both our countries have gone through considerable
changes since 1979, even since we met in the

188
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:48,950
first Strategic & Economy Dialogue in 2009.
For our part, the United States has entered

189
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:57,929
a period of renewal, optimism, and new strength.
Thanks to the aggressive actions we took to

190
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,788
stimulate our economy and to stabilize our
financial sector in the wake of the recession,

191
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:08,460
our economy has gone from recession to recovery
to resurgence. Twelve point six million private

192
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:17,720
sector jobs added over those years; 63 straight
months of employment growth; $30 trillion

193
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,750
in household wealth has been added back since
the President and I took office. Unemployment

194
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,429
is down from 10 percent to 5.5 percent, and
I predict we’ll go lower. U.S. exports are

195
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:35,490
at record levels. U.S. businesses have served
as the Asia Pacific’s biggest source of

196
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,849
foreign direct investment. U.S. businesses
have invested over $620 billion in investment

197
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,709
stock in the region just in 2013.

198
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:54,808
And as we grow, we acknowledge our depending
– our deepening economic interdependence.

199
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:58,710
China is the largest destination for U.S.
exports – you all know that – outside

200
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,480
of North America. Our country engages – our
countries engage in over half a trillion dollars

201
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,819
in trade every year, and it’s destined to
grow. Because of the strong economic ties,

202
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:18,399
China’s success benefits our own, as I said,
just as our economic resurgence supports China’s

203
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,259
growth. In just the last year or two, for
example, China has made some changes to promote

204
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:29,069
Chinese household consumption and allow more
market-determined interest rates. As your

205
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:35,678
third plenum laid out, there was a need to
open the economy to private sector competition,

206
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,470
implement market-based exchange rates, and
to grant greater market access to foreign

207
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,000
investors. That was your decision, not ours.
Your plenum made that judgment.

208
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,990
We recognize the advances that China has made,
and we encourage further progress in this

209
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:58,288
effort to reform the economy. And we know
the remarkable potential of the Chinese people.

210
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:03,429
As we build toward the future that realizes
the full potential of both our countries,

211
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:08,150
success in the Strategic & Economic Dialogue
and the Consultation on People-to-People Exchanges

212
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,340
is critical.

213
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:18,079
Over the past few days, you have had an opportunity
to make substantive progress on nonproliferation,

214
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,389
strong and balanced economic growth, trade
and investment, climate change, energy, environment,

215
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:30,038
ocean conservation, maritime security, cyber
issues, human rights, sustainable development,

216
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:35,329
public health, education. We’re not going
to solve all these problems in this meeting

217
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:42,269
or in multiple meetings, but we have to be
committed to working towards solutions in

218
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,359
each of these areas.

219
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:49,428
I need not tell you all that are participating
we have a lot of hard work to do, but we have

220
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:59,400
to keep at it day after day after day after
day. This relationship is just too important.

221
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,230
Not only do we depend on it, but the world
depends on our mutual success. To put it bluntly,

222
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,140
the world is depending on those of you in
this room to continue to work through those

223
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:18,919
issues. There’s an old Chinese proverb that
says one generation plants a tree, the next

224
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,590
enjoys the shade. Today we gather in the shade
of a tree planted by those visionaries on

225
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:31,449
both sides of the Pacific who joined hands
a generation ago, and now we have to plant

226
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,480
additional trees together, today, so the generations
that follow in both of our countries and around

227
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,278
the world can grow and flourish in the shade,
prosperity, security of a new friendship.

228
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:51,308
There will be intense competition. We will
have intense disagreements. That’s the nature

229
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:57,950
of international relations. But there are
important issues where we don’t see eye

230
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,298
to eye, but it doesn’t mean we should stop
working hand in hand because we don’t see

231
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:08,369
eye to eye. There was a famous American politician
who we all loved – his name was Tip O’Neill

232
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:14,139
– who was speaker of the House. He said
all politics is local. Well, I’m getting

233
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:20,799
old enough and I’ve hung around long – as
long as he had in the House and Senate and

234
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,898
in politics, and I’m going to presume to
try to improve on that. I believe that all

235
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:35,359
politics, especially international politics,
is personal. It’s all personal. And – because

236
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:41,099
only by building a personal relationship – that’s
the only vehicle by which you can build trust.

237
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:50,038
Doesn’t mean you have to even like the other
person, but it has to be a personal relationship

238
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,089
where you understand what the other guy needs,
the other woman needs, and what you need,

239
00:24:55,089 --> 00:25:00,459
and work through it. That’s the only way
to build trust.

240
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,370
Because of President Hu and President Obama,
I had the opportunity to spend scores of hours

241
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:12,979
with President Xi when he was vice president.
He even was nice enough to see me for five

242
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:22,610
hours when he was president. I think I know
him. We know him. We know his aspirations

243
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:26,009
for your country.

244
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:33,970
So as I told her last time we met, I’m particularly
grateful that Vice Premier Liu is – for

245
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:43,740
everything she’s done to help build the
face relationship that, as a Chinese co-chair,

246
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,359
the Consultation on People-to-People Exchanges
– it’s important. The exchange has led

247
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,449
to concrete progress in our relationship from
an increased number of Americans studying

248
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,769
in China to a program connecting young, professional
scientists through in-person exchanges. These

249
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:06,210
accomplishments are critical to expanding
cooperation in areas such as the arts, education,

250
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,058
women’s issues, science and technology.

251
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:15,119
So I want to thank her again for her leadership,
and I want to thank Secretary Kerry for the

252
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:23,449
hard work he’s put in this effort as well.
And it’s now my honor to introduce premier

253
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,000
– am I doing the introduction? I am, okay.
(Laughter.) I was about to take advantage

254
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:56,099
of this opportunity, but Liu Yandong as our
next speaker. Thank you. (Applause.)

255
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:01,599
VICE PREMIER LIU: (Via interpreter) Vice President
Biden, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Jacob Lew,

256
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:09,808
ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, good morning.
I want to thank Vice President Biden for his

257
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:19,690
speech. During Vice President Biden’s visit
to China, the Chinese people were very impressed

258
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:27,350
and in his speech he particularly emphasized
the importance of China-U.S. relations from

259
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:34,048
a global context. He talked about common interests
of our two countries, the common challenges,

260
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:40,839
and our respective responsibilities. And that
fully shows the leaders of the United States

261
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:47,709
and the American Government the high level
of importance they attach to the relations

262
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:55,490
with China. So I want to thank the Vice President
for that.

263
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:07,579
According to the agreement of the two countries,
the seventh S&ED and the sixth CPE have a

264
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:14,609
joint opening ceremony this morning. This
is the first time that the two mechanisms

265
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:20,449
and three dialogues are held concurrently
in the United States. It is of very special

266
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,038
and important significance. Vice Premier Wang
Yang and State Councilor Yang Jiechi and I

267
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:32,960
are particularly happy to be back in Washington,
D.C. again, which is a very beautiful city,

268
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:43,490
and to co-chair respectively with Secretary
Kerry and Secretary Lew for the two mechanisms.

269
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:49,558
Representatives from both sides are gathered
together, and the scale is unprecedented.

270
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:57,690
We have 13 ministers and 40 vice minister-level
officials from the Chinese side. And that

271
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:06,649
shows both sides take very seriously our bilateral
relations.

272
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:12,469
First of all, I wish to, on behalf of Vice
Premier Wang Yang and State Councilor Yang

273
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:19,079
Jiechi and all the entire Chinese delegation,
our appreciation to the thoughtful and meticulous

274
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:30,009
arrangements made by the U.S. side. (Applause.)
President Xi Jinping takes this S&ED and CPE

275
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:36,548
very close to his heart, and he asked me and
Vice Premier Wang Yang and State Councilor

276
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:56,609
Yang Jiechi to bring a message for President
Obama and convey his greetings and best wishes

277
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:04,469
to President Obama, Vice President Biden,
the two secretaries and all the colleagues

278
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,579
from the U.S. side. He believes that the new
model of major country relations featuring

279
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:17,349
mutual benefits, win-win cooperation, non-confrontation
is the priority of China’s foreign policy.

280
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:23,129
Facing complicated and volatile international
situation, China and the United States should

281
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:35,380
work together. They can work together in a
wide range of areas. The two sides should

282
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:45,610
keep the bilateral ties on the right track.
As long as our two countries adopt an overall

283
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:51,668
perspective, respect and accommodate each
other’s core interests and be committed

284
00:30:51,669 --> 00:31:02,659
to a constructive approach to reduce misunderstanding
and miscalculations, we can manage our differences

285
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:08,769
and maintain our common interests.

286
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:15,250
He expressed a hope that the two teams will
keep up the good work to take full advantage

287
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:25,569
of the role of the S&ED and CPE to promote
mutual trust and cooperation between the two

288
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:31,950
countries and to ensure that the bilateral
ties will bring benefits to people of the

289
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,919
two countries and people of the entire world.

290
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:42,730
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, the Consultation
on People-to-People Exchange together with

291
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,990
political mutual trust and business ties are
intertwined and reinforcing each other. They

292
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,528
form the three major pillars of China-U.S.
relations. Since 2010 when the CPE mechanism

293
00:31:56,528 --> 00:32:04,278
was established, China and the United States
have held five rounds of consultations and

294
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:12,329
achieved nearly 300 concrete deliverables.
I’m happy to see that the people-to-people

295
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:18,769
exchange between our two countries today has
expanded to cover more areas, as Vice President

296
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:28,109
Biden said – that the CPE from four major
areas add to the first round of the consultation

297
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:37,750
now covers seven areas, and this time we’ll
add public health into the dynamics.

298
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:45,538
We have now involved multiple stakeholders,
and it is shortening the distance between

299
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:51,210
people of our two countries and increased
mutual trust and friendship. And this mechanism

300
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:59,139
is now showing its increasingly unique charm
and important role and has forcefully promoted

301
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:02,839
steady and sound growth of China-U.S. relations.

302
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:11,209
As we say in China, even a thousand-story
tower starts from piles of earth, and in today’s

303
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,210
world we’re living in a global village and
countries have become a community of common

304
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:22,750
destiny and intertwined interests. The building
of the new model of major country relations

305
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:30,339
not only needs efforts from politicians and
diplomats, but more importantly, understanding

306
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:37,408
and support from our people, especially those
at the grassroot level. The theme of the CPE

307
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:45,830
this year is exchanges, mutual learning for
win-win cooperation. Our two countries will

308
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:52,038
reach a series of practical and concrete outcomes
in education, science and technology, culture,

309
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:54,528
sports, women, youth, and health.

310
00:33:54,528 --> 00:34:02,528
We are looking forward to working together
with the U.S. side to build more platforms

311
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:09,820
for mutual understanding of our two peoples
and create conditions for mutual learning

312
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:17,500
between civilizations from East and West,
so that hundred millions of students, scientists,

313
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,730
artists, and people from different walks of
life, including our women and young people,

314
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:31,510
to feel and share the joy of exchanges and
harvests so that this new model of major country

315
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,600
relations of China and the United States will
have greater warmth, resilience, depth, and

316
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,299
breadth.

317
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:52,660
Here I wish to express my belief and hope
that the 7th S&ED and 6th CPE will be a complete

318
00:34:52,659 --> 00:35:10,799
success. Now I would like to invite the American
chair of the 6th CPE, Secretary Kerry, to

319
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:19,380
deliver his speech. Secretary Kerry with his
wisdom, capabilities has impressed all of

320
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:28,980
us deeply, especially in the 5th consultation
in Beijing. The music he played with a Chinese

321
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:38,980
instrument pipa attracted 6 million Chinese
fans. And now I would like to give the floor

322
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:46,820
to Secretary Kerry. (Applause.)

323
00:35:46,820 --> 00:36:00,000
SECRETARY KERRY: Mr. Vice President, thank
you very much. We appreciate your comments

324
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,619
enormously. Vice Premier Liu, thank you very
much. I’m looking for the royalties on those

325
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:15,319
6 million fans. (Laughter.) State Councilor
Yang and Vice Premier Wang, distinguished

326
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,210
guests, members of the Chinese and American
delegations, and I particularly want to warmly

327
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:28,619
welcome both our ambassadors – the ambassador
from China – Ambassador Cui and my friend

328
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:35,889
Max Baucus back here. And I particularly also
am happy to see our fellow members of the

329
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:43,719
President’s cabinet here, and I think the
numbers of participants really underscores

330
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,829
the importance of this meeting.

331
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,949
This is the 3rd Strategic & Economic Dialogue
in which I’ve had the pleasure of participating

332
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:57,869
directly, and I’m confident that we’re
going to be able to take full advantage of

333
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:09,359
the chance to expand our bilateral cooperation.
We particularly look forward to September,

334
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:18,090
when President Xi will pay a state visit to
the United States, to Washington, and we’re

335
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,400
confident that when our presidents meet again,
if we do our work well over the course of

336
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,960
these next months, we will be able to advance
this relationship.

337
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,510
As the Vice President noted in his remarks,
we have taken a number of very positive steps

338
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:45,460
over the course of the past year. These include,
perhaps first and foremost, an historic announcement

339
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,659
on climate change. In addition, nurturing
confidence between our militaries as we have

340
00:37:51,659 --> 00:38:02,659
increased our mil-to-mil engagement, extending
visa validation reciprocity, working very

341
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:12,539
solidly together as partners in the P5+1 negotiations
on Iran, and helping our friends in West Africa

342
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:18,940
combat the deadly Ebola virus. And I had a
chance last night – we had a wonderful dinner

343
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:27,170
at Mount Vernon last night, a very open and
freewheeling discussion in the course of that,

344
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:34,760
but we really were able to isolate those things
on which we differ and talk about them in

345
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,100
reasonable ways, but most importantly get
excited about the possibilities of cooperation

346
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,110
between these two great nations.

347
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:51,130
We believe that the steps we’ve taken over
the course of the last year are important

348
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:59,869
in and of themselves. But they also have a
larger value, because when other nations see

349
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:08,369
China and the United States working together,
it tends to galvanize their own efforts. It

350
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:17,819
tends to increase their focus on similar issues.
So more and more I think we have both decided

351
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:25,320
that our partnership is an essential starting
point to the resolution of global problems,

352
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,370
and that this partnership can indeed become
even more important in terms of providing

353
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:38,250
a better sense of structure and order in a
world where there is an increasing sense of,

354
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:46,019
at least in some places, disorder or even
chaos.

355
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:52,199
This week, in these next two days, we have
a very, very full agenda. It includes building

356
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,989
on the progress that we’ve already made
in the field of sustainable energy cooperation,

357
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:06,209
the environment, and curbing greenhouse gas
emissions. This topic alone, frankly, validates

358
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:14,159
our dialogue, because unless our countries
lead on these issues, meaningful gains are

359
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:23,679
simply not going to happen. And if you take
the judgment of scientists with the seriousness

360
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:30,869
that one should, we all understand the serious
consequences of not achieving progress.

361
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:38,519
We’ve made a good start, but we all understand
we have to do more within and beyond our borders.

362
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:45,679
We have to drive home the urgency of growing
economically in ways that are green and clean.

363
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:52,119
And as Secretary Moniz and Secretary Pritzker
and Secretary Lew and all of us will underscore,

364
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,130
the energy market is the biggest market in
the world. It can drive all of our economies,

365
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,619
and it is a growing market as we go from some
six billion people to nine billion people

366
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:11,009
on the face of this planet – all of whom
will be consumers of energy.

367
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:17,200
So we believe that we can contribute to shared
prosperity by coordinating in addition on

368
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,809
development policy, which is something that
our countries have never done before. This

369
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,880
is something that State Councilor Yang Jiechi
began a discussion on over a year ago in Boston,

370
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,530
and President Obama and President Xi have
agreed and put focus on it with a determination

371
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,600
that if the United States and China could
together find development projects on which

372
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:50,420
we could cooperate, we could exponentially
leverage that much more positive outcome.

373
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,250
On the strategic track, we will review the
possibilities for further cooperation on Afghanistan;

374
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,210
the Iran nuclear negotiations, which we go
to towards the end of this week and are reaching

375
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:09,420
a pivotal moment; on counterterrorism and
the Middle East. We will talk about regional

376
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:16,200
security in the Asia Pacific, including stability
in the Korean Peninsula, and the need to reduce

377
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:23,779
tensions rather than add to them in the South
China Sea and the East China Seas. We will

378
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:32,580
devote a special session to coordinating oceans
policy, which is hugely important environmentally,

379
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:40,069
economically, and obviously from the perspective
of international order and law. And we look

380
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:45,630
forward to a very frank discussion of cyber
security and other ongoing concerns, such

381
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,150
as internet freedom, human rights, and religious
liberty.

382
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:59,059
Now, we are aware – obviously, and both
speakers have already referenced this – that

383
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:07,469
we will not agree on all issues. No nations
agree on every issue. But we do not accept

384
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:15,389
that a narrowing of the differences is beyond
our reach. The dialogue between those who

385
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:22,769
already see eye to eye is not a particularly
interesting or necessary dialogue. But the

386
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:30,769
discussion that – a discussion that merely
restates longstanding positions becomes pretty

387
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:36,719
sterile. That’s not what we’re looking
for here. We’re not satisfied with simply

388
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:44,579
maintaining the status quo. Our relationship
is dynamic and it has grown and matured steadily

389
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,309
in the past decades, and most notably in recent
years. We each have a stake in continuing

390
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,630
that momentum.

391
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,920
One way to do that is through the sixth edition
of the Consultation on the People-to-People

392
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:07,200
Exchange. Contacts between our citizens in
the arenas of business, science, technology,

393
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:16,279
athletics, and the empowerment of women work
best when they are fully reciprocal and unfettered.

394
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,290
These contacts can take many forms – from
technical workshops, sports competitions,

395
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:28,480
to online conversations and the travel of
students back and forth across the Pacific.

396
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,800
Frankly, this is diplomacy on a retail basis,
and it’s some of the most important diplomacy

397
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,690
that we can do. It’s how we forge a comprehensive
partnership out of smaller friendships. And

398
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:49,300
this year, for the first time we will be focusing
on cooperation in the area of health. And

399
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:56,650
right now, as you imagine, that’s not a
bad topic for me. (Laughter.)

400
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:04,200
My colleagues, if we are going to reap a harvest
from the opportunities that are staring us

401
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:09,809
in the face – and they are many – than
we really need to be honest with each other.

402
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:14,090
And I hope that frankness is going to be the
hallmark of our conversations over the next

403
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:21,329
two days. We can’t promise one thing and
then do something else. We’ve got to live

404
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:27,610
up to the commitments that we make and the
world is looking to China and the United States

405
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:33,820
to fulfill commitments. That’s how we will
build a foundation for real cooperation, and

406
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:40,350
that is why we established the Strategic & Economic
Dialogue and the Consultation on People-to-People

407
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:44,460
Exchange in the first place. That is why we
are here today.

408
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:51,449
This is serious business. Last night, State
Councilor Yang Jiechi and I referenced the

409
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:56,919
fact that at any given moment, there are a
lot of conversations taking place in the world.

410
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:03,750
But at this particular moment, given the stakes,
given the interests, given the possibilities,

411
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,199
this is one of the most important conversations
that could be taking place. There is never

412
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:17,809
a routine moment in U.S.-China relations.
Every meeting matters. Every day matters.

413
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:23,880
And every decision matters, because of the
consequences that it may have for future choices.

414
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,340
So I echo the words of Vice President Biden:
We have to make the absolute most of these

415
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:34,539
two days. And as I look around this room at
the serious people who have gathered here

416
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:39,590
to do so, I’m confident that we’re going
to make this a success. I thank all of you

417
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:44,470
for taking part in this effort. A special
thanks to Vice President Biden for having

418
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:50,500
joined us this morning to kick this off, and
tomorrow President Obama is very much looking

419
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:56,610
forward to meeting with the delegation and
having a chance to close out this conversation.

420
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:04,849
So at this time it is my pleasure to ask you
all to join me in welcoming Vice Premier Wang.

421
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,409
(Applause.)

422
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:23,190
VICE PREMIER WANG: (Via interpreter) I don’t
want to enjoy the treatment enjoyed by Secretary

423
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:29,280
Kerry. I don’t have to stay there.

424
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:40,820
Secretary Kerry, Secretary Lew, ladies and
gentlemen, this round of dialogue precedes

425
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:47,610
President Xi’s first state visit to the
United States and is the last round of the

426
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:55,120
S&ED held in the United State during President
Obama’s term of office. This has conferred

427
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:02,039
a special and important mission upon our dialogue,
which involves hopes and expectations of both

428
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:08,509
presidents. The Chinese team will work with
our U.S. colleagues to lay a solid foundation

429
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:16,500
for a successful visit by President Xi and
add a mark of success for the Obama Administration.

430
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:23,210
In the past seven years, the S&ED has grown
broader and stronger, acquiring a richer agenda

431
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:31,530
and better format, and producing more fruitful
results. The two rounds of economic dialogue

432
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:42,120
have been held by the current governments,
yielding over 170 outcomes in various fields.

433
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,519
Substantive progress has been made on major
issues, including BIT negotiation, climate

434
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,759
change, and ITA expansion, injecting positive
energy to China-U.S. relations and common

435
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:04,740
development of the world. Some outcomes may
seem insignificant at this stage, but once

436
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:14,669
nurtured by the fountain of opportunity, these
seedlings will grow into large fields.

437
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:22,329
This is not just an expectation for the future,
but also a summary of the past. More importantly,

438
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:31,199
the dialogue mechanism itself shows the commitment
of both governments to work together for win-win

439
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:40,439
results. As such, it is conducive to boosting
the confidence of people and companies of

440
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:49,360
the two countries in developing closer cooperation
and exchanges. Today more than 10,000 Chinese

441
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,910
and Americans travel across the Pacific every
day, and the number keeps growing at a double-digit

442
00:49:54,909 --> 00:50:02,909
rate. Two-way trade has exceeded U.S. $550
billion, and China has become one of the fastest-growing

443
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:09,159
export markets for the United States. U.S.
exports to China have helped to create nearly

444
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:17,219
1 million jobs in the U.S. Accumulated mutual
investment topped U.S. $120 billion. And Chinese

445
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:23,059
businesses have so far made investment in
44 states of America, with total investment

446
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:30,659
reaching U.S. $46 billion and creating 80,000
jobs for America, and the numbers are still

447
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,539
growing.

448
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:39,619
With such convergence of the two countries’
interests, which has gone beyond many people’s

449
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:49,409
imagination, neither of us could afford the
cost of noncooperation or even all-out confrontation.

450
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:54,099
Our high-level, multidimensional dialogue
is a testament to the greater maturity of

451
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:59,839
relations between our two nations. Dialogue
helps us understand each other’s thinking

452
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:07,590
and get to the crux of how to make cooperation
work and better handle differences.

453
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:16,329
On some issues, perhaps, consensus still eludes
us. However, talking to each other could help

454
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:24,489
pave the way to finding a solution, or at
least help keep our differences under control.

455
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:32,989
Although dialogue may fall short of expectation,
and sometimes nothing much is achieved, leaving

456
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:47,229
everybody unhappy, yet it would always be
more preferable than confrontation. Some people

457
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:54,039
believe that the Thucydides trap between major
countries is insurmountable. Some even want

458
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,489
China and the United States to confront each
other. In any case, decision-makers of both

459
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:05,409
countries must always remember that confrontation
is a negative sum game in which both sides

460
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:10,000
will pay heavy prices and the world will suffer
too.

461
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,510
Talking to each other does not create win-win
all the time, but both sides will lose in

462
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:24,030
a case of confrontation. Our dialogue mechanism
may not be perfect, but it is an indispensable

463
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:30,570
platform for the two countries to increase
mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and manage

464
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:35,470
differences.

465
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:41,059
History teaches us that China and the United
States must not follow the old path of confrontation

466
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:46,690
and conflict between major countries. Building
a new model of major country relations is

467
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:54,119
an effort to explore a new path towards peaceful
coexistence. This path may not be smooth and

468
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:01,589
the journey could be bumpy, but as a great
Chinese writer said: “Originally there is

469
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:10,900
no path – but as people walk down the same
track and again, a path appears.” I’m

470
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:24,110
convinced that we are on the right track.
Thank you. (Applause.)

471
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:32,789
And now, I welcome my rival, Secretary Jacob
Lew, to take the floor.

472
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:44,730
SECRETARY LEW: Good morning. I’d like to
join Vice President Biden and Secretary Kerry

473
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:50,769
in welcoming Vice Premier Liu, Vice Premier
Wang, State Councilor Yang, and the entire

474
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,239
Chinese delegation to Washington for this
seventh meeting of the Strategic & Economic

475
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:02,439
Dialogue. I’d also like to welcome all of
the members of the Chinese delegation, our

476
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,320
cabinet and Administration members, and our
two ambassadors who are here with us today.

477
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:15,420
I particularly welcome the opportunity to
co-chair our economic track discussions with

478
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,829
Vice Premier Wang with whom I’ve worked
so closely over the last several years and

479
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:25,679
who’s played a central role in strengthening
our bilateral cooperation. The Strategic & Economic

480
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,909
Dialogue is a key mechanism for generating
practical cooperation on issues across our

481
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:37,179
relationship, and it’s led to important,
tangible results for both sides. It also provides

482
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:42,079
an opportunity for frank, high-level discussions
on areas where we have concerns and need to

483
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,969
manage our differences and to work through
issues to prepare for a productive leaders

484
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:48,829
meeting in September.

485
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:52,699
Over the next two days, we will address a
range of economic issues of importance to

486
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:58,689
the American and Chinese people. These include
promoting strong, sustainable, and balanced

487
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:04,909
growth; enhancing financial sector reform
and stability; and emphasizing our joint responsibilities

488
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:10,889
in upholding high governance and standards
in the international economic system. We’ll

489
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:17,230
also discuss candidly and work to make progress
on areas of concern, such as cyber security,

490
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:23,309
barriers to open trade and investment, and
exchange rate reform. Together, the United

491
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:28,940
States and China account for a third of global
gross domestic product, and nearly 40 percent

492
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,320
of recent global growth.

493
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,809
We have an enormous stake in each other’s
economic performance. As the world’s two

494
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:41,699
largest economies, a mutually beneficial economic
relationship is of great importance not only

495
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:47,710
to the prosperity of our own peoples but to
the health and development of the global economy.

496
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:52,280
The U.S. economy has strengthened in the past
year led by strong private demand. Though

497
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,810
growth slowed somewhat in early 2015, in part
due to temporary factors, the near-term outlook

498
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:03,769
in momentum remains strong. Improved labor
market conditions, along with the recent sharp

499
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:09,179
decline in energy prices, have been a boon
to consumers, helping to lift consumer confidence

500
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,239
to its highest level in a decade.

501
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,279
Continued strong growth in China, particularly
growth based increasingly on domestic demand,

502
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:23,330
is also essential to global growth and prosperity.
We support China’s economic reform agenda,

503
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:27,889
including efforts to allow the market to play
a more decisive role in the economy and rely

504
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:34,859
more on consumption to drive China’s economic
growth. As part of these reforms, it’s critical

505
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:39,340
that China continue to move to a more market-determined
exchange rate and a more transparent exchange

506
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,070
rate policy.

507
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,370
We have a shared interest and a joint responsibility
to pursue policies that support the global

508
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:50,960
economy, as well as uphold and continue to
improve the global economic and financial

509
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,329
architecture. This includes responsibilities
to abide by certain standards of behavior

510
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:01,549
within cyber space. We remain deeply concerned
about government-sponsored cyber theft from

511
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:05,870
companies and commercial sectors. The United
States and China have a shared interest in

512
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:11,960
ensuring that the internet continues to drive
growth and prosperity worldwide. We look forward

513
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,280
to discussing these matters further.

514
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,300
China has a significant role in the global
economic and financial architecture, and we

515
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:25,410
hope China will work with us to maintain and
advance high standards in multilateral institutions.

516
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:31,819
This is especially critical as we head into
China’s G20 host year. We must work to achieve

517
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:38,150
a mutually beneficial bilateral economic relationship,
including through a trade and investment relationship

518
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:44,030
that provides a level playing field, promotes
innovation, and supports jobs and growth.

519
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:49,600
We must work together to show leadership on
financing to combat climate change. We look

520
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,579
forward to working with China as it continues
to deepen its domestic financial market reforms

521
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,380
and becomes more integrated into the global
financial system.

522
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,650
Our goal is to continue to make concrete,
tangible progress on our respective issues

523
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:09,030
of concern in order to deliver mutual benefits
to the United States and China. We intend

524
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,100
to use this forum, built up over the past
decade and involving engagement at the most

525
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,349
senior levels of both of our governments,
to tackle difficult issues – issues that,

526
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:22,349
if left unaddressed, would hinder the bilateral
relationship.

527
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:27,089
I’m confident that we will continue to make
the kind of concrete progress during the seventh

528
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:32,550
round of the S&ED that we’ve made in the
past. We look to productive and cooperative

529
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:38,650
discussions over the next two days as we address
the mutual challenges that we face. And with

530
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,030
that, please join me in welcoming our next
speaker, State Councilor Yang. (Applause.)

531
00:58:42,030 --> 00:59:09,250
STATE COUNCILOR YANG: (Via interpreter) Secretary
Kerry, Secretary Lew, Vice Premier Liu, Vice

532
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:18,050
Premier Wang, ladies and gentlemen, friends:
It gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity

533
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:28,240
to attend the seventh round of S&ED and attend
the joint opening session for the seventh

534
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:41,609
S&ED and sixth CPE. I see many colleagues
and friends that I know, but I also spot some

535
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:47,190
new friends among the audience, so it gives
me great pleasure to meet with all of you.

536
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:56,849
We live in a complex and fast-changing world
with new opportunities and new challenges

537
00:59:56,849 --> 01:00:06,750
emerging all the time. Countries are seeking
reform, development and incorporation to keep

538
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:15,750
up with the trend of the times. China and
the United States, as the world’s biggest

539
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:24,489
developing country and the biggest developed
country, need to stand high and look far under

540
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:33,439
the changing circumstances, stay committed
to China-U.S. relations, and work together

541
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:42,360
for world peace and development of all countries.

542
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:49,950
Maybe there aren’t as many skyscrapers in
Washington as those in New York, but here

543
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:57,169
in Washington, D.C. we still can stand high
and look far, and let us work together to

544
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:10,070
build a new model of major country relationship.
Why? Because our two countries are countries

545
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:17,230
with major influence in the world, and both
of us are committed to promoting peace, stability

546
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:31,059
and development of the world. Our two countries
are in the Pacific region. At last year’s

547
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:44,440
APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Beijing,
we reached agreement to have an FTAAP. We

548
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:51,809
hope that we can stay the course for the free
trade agreement in the Asia Pacific. Both

549
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:58,289
our two countries believe that we need to
uphold the purpose and principles of the UN

550
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:06,579
charter, and take those purpose and principles
as the norms governing international relations.

551
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:17,269
China is a participant in promoting the international
order and we have benefited from the international

552
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:22,039
order. We will work with the United States
and indeed, for that matter, all other countries

553
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:34,079
in the world to push for a more just and fair
international order. President Xi said that

554
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:43,079
we need to forge a community of shared destiny
for all mankind. We follow the principles

555
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:51,789
of sincerity, affinity, real benefit and inclusiveness
for our neighborhood. The Asia Pacific is

556
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:57,029
the most dynamic region in the world. In this
region, China and the United States should

557
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:05,260
work together. We hope that we can see even
better economic growth in the United States

558
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:11,480
because it serves the interests of all countries
around the world.

559
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:21,159
Just now, Vice President Biden, Secretary
Kerry and Secretary Lew all mentioned that

560
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:26,329
they want to see economic growth in China,
and they want to see closer business and trade

561
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:32,579
cooperation between the two countries. So
China’s development also serves the peace

562
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:39,909
and stability of the region and beyond. China
is committed to the path of peaceful development,

563
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:45,809
and China also hopes that other countries
around the world will also follow the course

564
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:52,929
of peaceful development. We believe that countries
around the world, regardless of their size

565
01:03:52,929 --> 01:04:01,199
and their strength, are equal members of the
international community. We are committed

566
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,299
to promoting democracy and international relations.

567
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:10,160
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the
founding of the United Nations. We hope that

568
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:16,899
we can work together to uphold the outcome
of victory of the Second World War, continue

569
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:25,050
to follow norms governing international relations
with the UN charter at its core. China and

570
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:34,230
the United States opened the door to diplomatic
engagement in 1972. Despite ups and downs

571
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:41,940
in our bilateral relations, this relationship
has followed the right track in general, and

572
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:50,490
both countries have benefited from this relationship.
Areas of cooperation far outnumber the areas

573
01:04:50,489 --> 01:05:03,599
of competition. With regard to competition,
I am a patriot, but I still believe that for

574
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:12,519
Chinese basket team to have a draw outcome
with the U.S. basketball team, that will be

575
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:21,179
a tall order, and vice versa for the U.S.
ping-pong team to win the Chinese ping-pong

576
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:27,649
team. That will be – that will take some
time.

577
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:33,090
So the point I’m driving at is that both
of us have our respective strengths. We need

578
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:41,070
to be mutually complementary to each other.
We need to turn competition into cooperation.

579
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:47,130
As a matter of fact, we have already started
doing so. In Asia, we are helping some developing

580
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:55,740
countries on their water conservancy projects
to improve their peoples’ lives. We are

581
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:04,250
ready to work with the U.S. in Africa and
other regions. We are promoting a strategy

582
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:10,469
of strengthening the country through science
and technology. One important aspect of this

583
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:16,829
strategy is to protect intellectual property
rights. In this regard, we stand ready for

584
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:20,670
closer cooperation with the U.S.

585
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:29,670
Our two countries have made instructions to
further China-U.S. relations under the new

586
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:34,190
situation. Our task is to make this round
a resonating success and live up to the expectations

587
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:39,170
of our presidents and the people of our two
countries. I hope that our dialogue will help

588
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:44,950
us better understand each other’s domestic
and foreign policies and view each other’s

589
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:51,269
strategic intentions in the right way, so
that we can reduce suspicion, prevent miscalculation,

590
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:57,710
and cement the foundation of our cooperation.
I hope our dialogue will help us build common

591
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:02,210
ground and work through differences on the
sensitive issues.

592
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:08,309
We need to work in the same direction, respect
and accommodate each other’s core interests

593
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:20,929
and major concerns, manage our differences
in the relevant areas, and stay on the right

594
01:07:20,929 --> 01:07:31,299
track of building a new model of major country
relations between our two countries. The growing

595
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:41,640
business ties and the growing world economy
will benefit from navigation freedom across

596
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:49,219
the world. China is firmly for navigation
freedom across the world. We hope that our

597
01:07:49,219 --> 01:08:03,980
two sides can work together to ensure that
the global economy can improve in the right

598
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,960
direction.

599
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:13,490
We need to keep the transparency of regional
trading architecture and framework and openness.

600
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:24,960
We hope that in promoting trade liberalization,
in trade in services, to have – to achieve

601
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,980
bigger things in this regard. We hope – we
believe that cyber security is very important.

602
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:45,449
We think that countries should work together
to develop international code of conduct for

603
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:49,909
cyber information sharing.

604
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:58,298
We will work with the United States and other
countries to work in the spirit of openness,

605
01:08:58,298 --> 01:09:11,069
to properly address the relevant issues. We
hope that this round of S&ED will achieve

606
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:17,330
positive outcomes. I look forward to working
with Secretary Kerry for exchanges of views.

607
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:24,939
We hope that our dialogue will help us further
expand win-win cooperation. For example, deepening

608
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:33,059
practical cooperation on energy, environmental
protection, law enforcement, and so on. We

609
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:38,810
need to promote positive interaction and inclusive
cooperation in the Asia Pacific, and we need

610
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:45,000
to strengthen communication and coordination
on such regional hotspot issues as the Iranian

611
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,119
and Korean nuclear issues. We need to tap
potential of cooperation on climate change,

612
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,899
marine conservation, and global development.

613
01:09:54,899 --> 01:10:01,239
Our work together will not only bring more
tangible benefits to our two peoples, but

614
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:16,059
also serve peace, stability, and prosperity
in the Asia Pacific and the world at large.

615
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:21,370
Like what Vice Premier Wang and Vice Premier
Liu and Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew

616
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:30,479
– they all had their mission to introduce
the next speaker. I don’t have this task.

617
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,559
But I also have a glorious mission, that is
I want to thank each and every one of you

618
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:42,180
to be here for this opening session. I want
to thank you all for you contribution to China-U.S.

619
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:49,329
relationship and for the success of our S&ED
and the CPE. Thank you all. (Applause.)
